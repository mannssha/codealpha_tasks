# Emotion Recognition from Speech 🎤😃😢😠

This project detects human emotions (like happy, sad, angry, etc.) from speech using MFCC feature extraction and LSTM model.

## 📁 Dataset
Use the RAVDESS dataset (or TESS/EMO-DB) and update the `dataset_path` in `main.py`.

## 🚀 Features
- MFCC feature extraction
- LSTM-based classification
- High-level accuracy with deep learning

## 📦 Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

## 📝 Note
Change `"path_to_ravdess_dataset"` in the code to your local dataset path.
